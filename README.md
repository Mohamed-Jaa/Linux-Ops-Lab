# 🛡️ Linux Infrastructure & Automation Lab

> **From "GUI User" to "Systems Engineer": A documentation of my journey into the depths of Linux Administration, Cloud Security, and DevOps Automation.**

---

## 🎯 Project Vision
This repository is not just a collection of scripts; it is a **digital workshop**.
I created this lab to bridge the gap between academic theory and real-world application. As an aspiring **Cloud Network & Security Engineer**, my goal is to master the Linux ecosystem by simulating production-level scenarios and solving them using native tools (Bash, Systemd, Networking).

**Core Objectives:**
* 🚀 **Mastering the CLI:** Moving away from graphical interfaces to total terminal control.
* 🤖 **Automation:** Learning how to make the server manage itself using Shell Scripting and Cron.
* 🔒 **Security First:** Implementing permissions, firewalls, and secure access protocols from day one.

## 🧠 Learning Methodology
This project follows a **"Problem-Based Learning"** approach. Instead of following random tutorials, I treat every concept as a **Ticket (Task)** that needs to be solved:

1.  **The Scenario:** A simulation of a real infrastructure problem (e.g., "Server crashed due to full disk").
2.  **The Investigation:** diagnosing the issue using Linux analysis tools.
3.  **The Solution:** Writing a script or configuration to fix the issue permanently.
4.  **The Documentation:** explaining the "Why" and "How" for future reference.

## 🛠️ Technical Scope
This lab covers the following domains of System Administration:

| Domain | Key Skills & Tools |
| :--- | :--- |
| **System Control** | Process Management, Service Configuration (systemd), User & Group Permissions. |
| **Automation** | Bash Scripting, Cron Scheduling, Variable Handling, Text Processing (`awk`, `grep`). |
| **Networking** | SSH Security, Firewall Management (UFW), Web Server Configuration (Nginx). |
| **Storage** | Disk Management, Partitioning, Archiving & Backup Strategies (`tar`). |

## 📂 Repository Structure
The project is organized into modular "Task Folders" to keep the workspace clean and navigable:

* **`Task_XXX_Name/`**: Contains the solution script and a detailed technical report.
* **`docs/`**: (Optional) General documentation and cheat sheets.
